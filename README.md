# Fundus2Gender

In order to evaluate AI-based approaches for sex determination on Color Fundus Photography, we have performed meticulous analyses including the reproducibility of the results from Poplin et al. (2018), the evaluation of a deep learning (DL) approach for assessing the informative relevance of previously known and human interpretable features compared to unknown/unstructured image information and finally, assessment of human performance against that of AI.
